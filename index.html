                    Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface
                    (called the "matrix" or "support"). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but
                    other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is
                    called "a painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas,
                    wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple
                    other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition,
                    gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract
                    art). Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape
                    painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in
                    Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).

                    A portion of the Elements of Painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art.
                    Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to
                    Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha

                <p>
                    The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old, found in both the Franco-Cantabrian
                    region in western Europe, and in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia). Cave
                    paintings were then found in Kalimantan, Indonesia in the Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave believed to be
                    40,000 - 52,000 years old. More recently, in 2021, cave art of a pig found in an Indonesian island,
                    and dated to over 45,500 years, has been reported. However, the earliest evidence of the act
                    of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in Arnhem Land, in northern Australia. In the
                    lowest layer of material at these sites, there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years
                    old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone
                    rock-shelter in the Kimberley region of North-Western Australia, that is dated 40,000 years old.
                    There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Indonesia, France, Spain, Portugal,
                    Italy, China, Australia, Mexico, etc. In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting
                    have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In the East, ink and color ink
                    historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.
                    <br><br>
                    The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first
                    photograph was produced in 1829, photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced,
                    depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable
                    world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—notably Impressionism,
                    Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Dadaism—challenged the Renaissance view of
                    the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of stylization and did
                    not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time.
                    <br><br>
                    Modern and Contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in
                    favour of concept. This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice
                    painting either as a whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of painting in the
                    21st century defy the previous "declarations" of its demise. In an epoch characterized by the idea
                    of pluralism, there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to
                    make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments—their merits are
                    left to the public and the marketplace to judge.

                <img
                    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Chen_Hongshou%2C_leaf_album_painting.jpg/330px-Chen_Hongshou%2C_leaf_album_painting.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Color, made up of hue, saturation, and value, dispersed over a surface is the essence of painting,
                    just as pitch and rhythm are the essence of music. Color is highly subjective, but has observable
                    psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated
                    with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers, and
                    scientists, including Goethe, Kandinsky, and Newton, have written their own color theory.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. The word "red", for
                    example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light.
                    There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on
                    different notes in music, such as F or C♯. For a painter, color is not simply divided into basic
                    (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.).
                    <br><br>
                    Painters deal practically with pigments, so "blue" for a painter can be any of the blues:
                    phthalocyanine blue, Prussian blue, indigo, Cobalt blue, ultramarine, and so on. Psychological and
                    symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the
                    potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly
                    subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear—sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to
                    "light" in painting, "shades" to dynamics, and "coloration" is to painting as the specific timbre of
                    musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of
                    themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it.
