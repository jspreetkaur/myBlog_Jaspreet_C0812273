                        Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High
                        Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor
                        and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also
                        became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects,
                        including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo's genius
                        epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works compose a contribution to
                        later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary,
                        Michelangelo.
                        <br><br>
                        Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was
                        educated in Florence by the renowned Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He
                        began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in
                        Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while
                        attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he
                        spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been
                        a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have
                        failed to incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in
                        culture.
                        <br><br>

                        Leonardo is among the greatest painters in the history of art and is often credited as the
                        founder of the High Renaissance. Despite having many lost works and less than 25 attributed
                        major works—including numerous unfinished works—he created some of the most influential
                        paintings in Western art. His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is his best known work and often
                        regarded as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious
                        painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017,
                        Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo, was sold at auction for US$450.3
                        million, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.

                <p>
                    Leonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (Leonardo, son of ser Piero from
                    Vinci), was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci; Florence
                    was 20 miles away. He was born out of wedlock to Ser Piero da Vinci  (Ser Piero di
                    Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser Guido da Vinci; 1426–1504), a Florentine legal notary, and
                    Caterina  (c. 1434 – 1494), from the lower-class. It remains uncertain where Leonardo
                    was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele
                    Repetti, is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient
                    privacy for the illegitimate birth, though, it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence,
                    which Ser Piero almost certainly had. Leonardo's parents both married separately the year
                    after his birth. Caterina—who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only "Caterina" or "Catelina"—is
                    usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero
                    Buti del Vacca, nicknamed "L'Accattabriga" ("the quarrelsome one"). Other theories have been
                    proposed, particularly that of art historian Martin Kemp, who suggested Caterina di Meo Lippi, an
                    orphan that married supposably with aid from Ser Piero and his family. Ser Piero married
                    Albiera Amadori—having been betrothed to her the previous year—and after her death in 1462, went on
                    to have three subsequent marriages. From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 12
                    half-siblings, who were much younger than he was (the last was born when Leonardo was 40 years old)
                    and with whom he had very little contact.
<br><br>
                    Very little is known about Leonardo's childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of
                    his biography in the frequently apocryphal Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and
                    Architects (1550) from the 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari. Tax records indicate
                    that by at least 1457 he lived in the household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci,
                    but it is possible that he spent the years before then in the care of his mother in Vinci, either
                    Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San Pantaleone. He is thought to have been close
                    with his uncle, Francesco da Vinci, but his father was likely in Florence most of the time.
                    Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an official residence in
                    Florence by at least 1469 and led a successful career. Despite his family history, Leonardo only
                    received a basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading and mathematics, possibly
                    because his artistic talents were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention
                    there.
                    <br><br>

                    Later in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus. While writing
                    on the flight of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth
                    with its tail; commentators still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.
